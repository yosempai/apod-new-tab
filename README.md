# apod-new-tab
A new tab / home page with NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day

First off, you will need to get an <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key">API key</a> from NASA to access the APOD data.

Once you have the key, you must create a config.js file in the includes/js directory (see sample file config-sample.js).

Set APOD_KEY to the API key you were granted, and you will be able to see a gorgeous new space-photo every day.
